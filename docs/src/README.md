### Welcome to the blockbench-import-library (BIL) wiki!

Documentation for version 1.1.6 and above.

blockbench-import-library (short BIL) is a library to help create serverside content with custom models and animations, without requiring client mods.

Custom Models and textures will be generated automatically - the resulting resourcepack is hosted through polymer autohost, no need to handle resourcepacks yourself!

With BIL you are able to load Blockbench and Animated Java files - it acts as a bridge between Blockbench and serverside content (like entities and blocks) for fabric, written using Polymer, allowing you to combine fancy custom models, textures and animations with completely custom block / mob logic.
